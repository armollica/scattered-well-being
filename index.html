      <h2>How do I read the graphic?</h2>
      <p>
        This is a data-distorted map of Mexico. Each square is a different.
        municipality. Bigger squares are municipalities with larger populations.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are six well-being indexes:
        <span style="color: rgb(30, 162, 226); font-weight: bold;">income</span>,
        <span style="color: rgb(127, 173, 62); font-weight: bold;">education</span>,
        <span style="color: rgb(51, 165, 148); font-weight: bold;">housing</span>,
        <span style="color: rgb(126, 56, 116); font-weight: bold;">health</span>,
        <span style="color: rgb(25, 126, 191); font-weight: bold;">jobs</span> and
        <span style="color: rgb(96, 96, 96); font-weight: bold;">safety</span>.
        The higher the index the better. The darker the color, the higher the index.
        In the case of the
        <span style="color: rgb(30, 162, 226); font-weight: bold;">income</span>
        index, a municipality whose residents have high incomes will be colored
        <span style="background-color: rgb(28, 107, 145); color: white; font-weight: bold; padding: 1px 3px; border-radius: 5px;">dark&#8239;blue</span>
        and those with low incomes will be colored
        <span style="background-color: rgb(222, 232, 237); color: rgb(24, 24, 24); font-weight: bold; padding: 1px 3px; border-radius: 5px;">light&#8239;blue</span>.
      </p>

        You can see the data sources and how the well-being indexes were
        calculated here:

      <h2>How can I interact with the graphic?</h2>

      <h4>Focus on a municipality:</h4>
      <p>
        Move your cursor over a square to see the information on a specific
        municipality. The bar chart shows how the municipality ranks in relation
        to all other municipalities. When a bar goes to the left it means the
        municipality is "below average" and when it goes to the right it is
        "above average". (the center is actually the median, not the mean). If a municipality has a well-being index that is greater
        than 90% of all other municipalities there will be a plus sign
        (<span style="font-weight: bold;">+</span>) at the end.
        Similarly, a minus sign (<span style="font-weight: bold;">-</span>)
        indicates the municipality has an index lower than 90% of all others.
      </p>

      <h4>Change the well-being index:</h4>
      <p>
        To change the well-being index that's displayed, click on the corresponding
        index on the legend to the right. The graphic starts out with
        the <span style="color: rgb(30, 162, 226); font-weight: bold;">income</span>
        index displayed.
      </p>

      <h4>Filter the municipalities:</h4>
      <p>
        Move your cursor over the different colors on the legend will limit the
        municipalities displayed to those that are in the hovered index and
        quantile. For example, if you hover over the
        <span style="background-color: rgb(92, 81, 81); color: white; font-weight: bold; padding: 1px 3px; border-radius: 5px;">dark grey</span>
        box on the far right of the
        <span style="color: rgb(96, 96, 96); font-weight: bold;">safety</span>
        row, you will only see municipalities with high safety indexes.

  <h2>Case studies:</h2>
  <p style="margin: 0 40px 50px 40px; font-style: italic;">
    Look in depth at the well-being measures for specific regions of Mexico.
  </p>

  <div class="case-study mexico-city">
    <h3>Mexico City</h3>
    <p>
      The capital city (officially known as the Distrito Federal) is the most
      densily populated area in Mexico. Mexico City ranks highly in most of the
      well-being measures. If you move you mouse over the darkest color for each
      map, you can see that most of the municipalities in Mexico City rank
      in the 80<span class="super">th</span> percentile.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one exception &mdash; safety.
      Most municipalities in Mexico City are below average &mdash; often in the
      40<span class="th">th</span> percentile or lower.
    </p>
    <div class="map-container"></div>
  </div>

  <div class="case-study guadalajara">
    <h3>Guadalajara</h3>
    <p>
      The capital of Jalisco, Guadalajara and its surrounding metro area
      comprise the second largest city of Mexico. Like Mexico City
      Guadalajara ranks highly in most well-being measures. Unlike Mexico City,
      however, Guadalajara ranks more favorably in the safety ranking. Most
      of the municipalities are in the
      40<span class="super">th</span>-60<span class="super">th</span> percentile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entire state of Jalisco ranks quite highly in education, even outside
      of Guadalajara. If you cursor over many of the smaller municipalities to
      the south of Guadalajara you can see that many rank in the
      90<span class="super">th</span> percentile or better.
    </p>
    <div class="map-container"></div>
  </div>

  <div class="case-study border-cities">
    <h3>The Border Cities</h3>
    <p>
      The border cities of Tijuana and Juárez (the two largest squares below) are
      among the highest ranking municipalities in terms of income and jobs.
      This is likely due in part to their close proximity to the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trade-off for any potential job-seekers planning to move to the area
      is safety. Both municipalities rank among the lowest in terms of safety
      due to the high rates of murder and sexual offense in the area.
    </p>
    <div class="map-container"></div>
  </div>

  <div class="case-study safe-south">
    <h3>The Safe South</h3>
    <p>
      Despite ranking relatively poorly in terms of income and education, the
      southern states of Oaxaca, Tlaxcala and Puebla are among to safest
      according to this measure of safety.
    </p>
    <div class="map-container"></div>
  </div>

  <div class="case-study education-divide">
    <h3>The Education Divide</h3>
    <p>
      Looking at these maps you get the sense that many of the differences
      in the well-being indexes can be explained by whether an area is urban
      or rural.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here appears to be one exception. In terms of education there is a clear
      divide along the border between the high ranking areas of Jalisco
      (left side of map) and the low ranking area of Michoacán de Ocampo
      (middle of map).
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at the jobs index, we see no similar division along state boundaries.
